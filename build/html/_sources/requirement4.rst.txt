.. admonition:: Additional Challenge

   *Britannica kids* has an excellent introduction to **genetic engineering** website you can find `here <https://kids.britannica.com/kids/article/genetic-engineering/600760>`_ where you can learn more about how it may be used to create helpful medical substances, such as vaccines. 

   
.. Note:: CRISPR
	   Did you know that Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2020 was awarded to Dr. Emmanuelle Charpentier (from the Max Planck Unit for the Science of Pathogens, Berlin, Germany) and to Dr. Jennifer A. Doudna (from University of California, Berkeley, USA) *for the development of a method for genome editing*, more specifically for developping CRISPR. Read more about it on the Nobel Prize `website <https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2020/press-release/>`_.
