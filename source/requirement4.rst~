++++++++++++++++++++++++++

:math:`\boxed{\mathbb{REQ}\Large \rightsquigarrow}` Do all of the following:

   A. Investigate your calculator and explore the different functions.
   B. Discuss the functions, abilities, and limitations of your calculator with your counselor. Talk about how these affect what you can and cannot do with a calculator. (See your counselor for some ideas to consider.)
   
.. Tip:: You can use an emulator of a scientific calculator on your smart phone for this requirement!

.. Admonition:: Additional Challenge

   Find out about **RPN**, which stands for `Reverse Polish Notation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation>`_. Try it and if you are like me, you    won't be able to use the old approach anymore. This is particulalry true if you find it difficult to use parentheses on your calculator! In addition, it has been shown that you will make fewer mistakes compare to using other types of calculators!
