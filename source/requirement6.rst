Requirement #6: Genetics @ life
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

:math:`\boxed{\mathbb{REQ}\Large \rightsquigarrow}` Discuss with your counselor how genetics and genomics affect your everyday life and how you think it will affect your life in the future.

.. admonition:: Additional Challenge

   Information is coded in DNA with 4 small molecules, also known as *bases*. Those molecules are usually referred to a "A", "C", "G", and "T". Can you find out what those letters stand for? As an additional challenge, find out what molecules are used to code information in RNA (see definition under Requirement #1). 
   

.. tip:: Genetic testing is a type of medical test that identifies changes in chromosomes, genes, or proteins. The results of a genetic test can confirm or rule out a suspected genetic condition or help determine a person's chance of developing or passing on a genetic disorder.

	 In addition to being used as medical tool, a number of people now test their DNA for tracing their roots and finding relatives.

	    Genetic testing can be done to find out about inherited mutations tied to a disease such as cancer, and thus take precautions before a cancer develops.  This image was obtained from https://www.uclahealth.org/cancer-genetics/genetic-testing-for-cancer where a short description is provided to show how genetic testing for cancer works.
