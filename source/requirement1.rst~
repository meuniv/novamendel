++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

:math:`\boxed{\mathbb{REQ}\Large \rightsquigarrow}` Choose A or B or C or D and complete ALL the requirements.
   
   A. Watch about three hours total of math-related shows or documentaries that involve scientific models and modeling, physics, sports equipment design, bridge building, or cryptography. Then do the following:
      
      (1) Make a list of at least five questions or ideas from the show(s) you watched.
      (2) Discuss two of the questions or ideas with your counselor.

      .. tip::  Some examples include—but are not limited to—shows found on PBS (“NOVA”), Discovery Channel, Science Channel, National Geographic Channel, TED Talks (online videos), and the History Channel. You may choose to watch a live performance or movie at a planetarium or science museum instead of watching a media production. You may watch online productions with your counselor’s approval and under your parent’s supervision.
	 
   B. Research (about three hours total) several websites (with your parent’s or guardian’s permission) that discuss and explain cryptography or the discoveries of people who worked extensively with cryptography. Then do the following:
      
      (1) List and record the URLs of the websites you visited and major topics covered on the websites you visited. (You may use the copy and paste function— eliminate the words—if you include your sources.)
      (2) Discuss wit hyour counselor how cryptography is used in the military and in everyday life and how a cryptographer uses mathematics.

   C. Read at least three articles (about three hours total) about physics, math, modeling, or cryptography. You may wish to read about how technology and engineering are changing sports equipment, how and why triangles are used in construction, bridge building, engineering, climate and/or weather models, how banks keep information secure, or about the stock market. Then do the following:
      
      (1) Make a list of at least two questions or ideas from each article
      (2) Discuss two of the questions or ideas with your counselor.

      .. tip::  Examples of magazines include—but are not limited to—Odyssey, Popular Mechanics, Popular Science, Science Illustrated, Discover, Air & Space, Popular Astronomy, Astronomy, Science News, Sky & Telescope, Natural History, Robot, Servo, Nuts and Volts, and Scientific American.

   D. Do a combination of reading, watching, and researching (about three hours total). Then do the following:

      (1) Make a list of at least two questions or ideas from each article, website, or show.
      (2) Discuss two of the questions or ideas with your counselor.

.. Admonition:: Additional Challenge

   Math and Logic are two sides of the same coin. Can you solve this logic problem?

   *There are three hats, each with an accompanying statement*

   * Hat One: The cat is in this hat.

   * Hat Two: The cat is not in this hat.

   * Hat Three: The cat is not in Hat One.


   *Exactly one of the statements is true. Exactly one hat contains a cat.* 
   
   **Which hat contains the cat?**
   
   
.. attention:: Once you have completed this requirement, make sure you document it in your worksheet!
